# Fabric-retieval-and-automatic-design


1. Fabric Retrieval


It is not original version, because original version will take too much time. Thus, This is simplifed version, but it still obtains a nice result.


The dataset is saved to .npy. If you want the original fabric images, you can contact me XD.




2. Fabric Automatic Design


I cannot simplify this model, because it will not work well enough.


The label of dataset is the categories of fabric patterns.
